## Data structures 

### Arrays / ArrayList

- Good for random access and when you know number of elements before itself
- Good for inserting elements at the end
- Each time the space gets over the ArrayList size expands to 2x leading to O(1) complexity for inserting at the end
- Bad for insertion at the start, takes O(n) time
- Bad for insertions and deletions in middle

### Linkedlist 

- Good for inserting at the start
- Good for deleting and adding in the middle
- Bad for random access

### stacks 

### queues 

### Hashmap 

- Buckets of linkedlist - this datastructure is as good as the hash keys
- O(1) average time complexity for insertion, deletion, update, access using key but worst can be O(n) for all


### Binary trees 

### Heaps 

### Graphs 


## Algorithms 

### Two pointer 

### Sliding window 

### Fast & slow pointer

### In-place Reversal of linkedlist && inverting binary tree

### Modified binary search 

### BFS 

### DFS 

### Topological sort 

### Islands ( Matrix traversal ) 

### Intervals 

### Top k elements 

### K way merge 

### Cyclic sort
